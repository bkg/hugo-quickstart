Hugo Quick Start
================

Running through the offical [Hugo quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

Install
-------

Not suprisingly, the Ubuntu apt package is out of date with the most recent
release of Hugo so I just grabbed the latest compiled binary.

Themes
------

Themes are added as Git submodules

    git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
